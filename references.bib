abstract = {Randomized clinical trials are ideal for estimating causal effects, because the distributions of background covariates are similar in expectation across treatment groups. When estimating causal effects using observational data, matching is a commonly used method to replicate the covariate balance achieved in a randomized clinical trial. Matching algorithms have a rich history dating back to the mid-1900s but have been used mostly to estimate causal effects between two treatment groups. When there are more than two treatments, estimating causal effects requires additional assumptions and techniques. We propose several novel matching algorithms that address the drawbacks of the current methods, and we use simulations to compare current and new methods. All of the methods display improved covariate balance in the matched sets relative to the prematched cohorts. In addition, we provide advice to investigators on which matching algorithms are preferred for different covariate distributions.},

We generalize these causal inference methods to the multi-level treatment case. We review the generalized causal inference framework and several propensity score estimation methods. We conduct a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of multinomial logistic regression, generalized boosted models, random forest and data adaptive matching score for estimating propensity scores based on inverse probability of treatment weighting. From our findings, multinomial logistic regression is susceptible to yielding extreme weights while a mis-specified model is assumed, which results in poor performance of the inverse probability weighted estimator. On the other hand, machine-learned propensity scores tend to have less biased and more stable performance, and the data adaptive matching score tends to perform the best overall. The above-mentioned propensity score based methods are applied to the Taobao dataset to evaluate the causal effect of reputation on sales.},

abstract = {Abstract The propensity score method is widely used in clinical studies to estimate the effect of a treatment with two levels on patient's outcomes. However, due to the complexity of many diseases, an effective treatment often involves multiple components. For example, in the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), an effective treatment may include multiple components, e.g. Chinese herbs, acupuncture, and massage therapy. In clinical trials involving TCM, patients could be randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group, but they or their doctors may make different choices about which treatment component to use. As a result, treatment components are not randomly assigned. Rosenbaum and Rubin proposed the propensity score method for binary treatments, and Imbens extended their work to multiple treatments. These authors defined the generalized propensity score as the conditional probability of receiving a particular level of the treatment given the pre-treatment variables. In the present work, we adopted this approach and developed a statistical methodology based on the generalized propensity score in order to estimate treatment effects in the case of multiple treatments. Two methods were discussed and compared: propensity score regression adjustment and propensity score weighting. We used these methods to assess the relative effectiveness of individual treatments in the multiple-treatment IMPACT clinical trial. The results reveal that both methods perform well when the sample size is moderate or large. Copyright Â© 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
